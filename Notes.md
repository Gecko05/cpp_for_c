# Notes

## Classes

### Access modifiers

**Public**: Accessible outside the class.
**Protected**: Accessible inside the class and sub-classes.
**Private**: Not accessible outside the class.
**Friend**: Lets a class or function access the private and protected methods.

### Constructors

Class constructors can specify the call to the parent class constructor. If not specified, the default constructor of the parent class is called just before the class constructor.
**endl** creates a new line after an output.

### Overload

*operator+* specifies that we're referring to the addition operator.
Multiple definitions with different types act as overload.
